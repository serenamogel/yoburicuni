She was born into a white American family in the year 1976, on the 28th day of May in Los Angeles, California. Many years later, she has not come to disclose information on who her family members are; her parents, and if she has any siblings or was born an only child.</p><p>But be that as it may, it is believed that Jordyn had a pleasant childhood growing up in Los Angeles where she also attended a private high school. According to some reports, she actively played soccer in high school and, in addition, Jordyn was also reported to have a knack for singing, dancing, and creative writing. Apparently, she has nurtured and retained some of these skills till now.</p><h3><strong>She Started Off Her Modeling Career While Still a Teenager</strong></h3><p>Jordyn Blum started her career as a model while still a teenager and was already famous at the age of 17. Rightly put, Jordyn knew early enough what she wanted to make out of her life. She began modeling in her late teens and by 1994 when she was about 18 years old, she was featured on the cover of Teen Magazine.</p><p>With her beautiful physique, Jordyn did well enough to attract several reputable brands to sign deals as their brand ambassador in the United States and she continued modeling into her early twenties before she sought a career change in the entertainment industry as a film director.</p><h3><strong>She Directed Her First Film in the Year 2002</strong></h3><p>Fresh on the job, Jordyn directed her first short film titled Foo Fighters: Walking a Line in 2002 alongside Chris Osterhus as co-director. The short film featured members of the Foo Fighters music&nbsp;band – Dave Grohl and Taylor Hawkins.</p><p>Next in her film directing portfolio, she was scheduled to direct a movie about the Foo Fighters but for reasons that have not been publicly disclosed, the project never saw the light of the day. She was then cast in The GQ Men of the Year Awards in 2003 alongside Adrien Brody and Monica Belluci.</p><p>Summarily, Jordyn Blum has only one film directorial credit for now but that does not make her less of a film director when compared to others with a long list of work in their portfolios. Jordy gives more of her attention to raising her kids, supporting her husband, and running their family in general.</p><h2><strong>David Grohl and&nbsp;</strong><strong>Jordyn Blum Met for the First Time in 2001</strong></h2><p>David Grohl and&nbsp;Jordyn Blum met in 2001 under not-so-pleasant circumstances.&nbsp;It happened that David was having drinks at the Sunset Marquis whiskey bar where Jordyn was also at. In his intoxicated state, he admired her and made a move toward getting to know her and this was surprisingly welcomed by Jordyn.</p><p>Reports had it that he scribbled the words “You’re my future wife” on a piece of paper he passed across to her. Dave also did get Jordyn drunk on their first meeting and their acquaintance which started in a comical manner blossomed into a relationship.</p><p>While they were dating, their relationship wasn’t typically like that of two perfect love birds. They had both their good terrible moments and the latter was prominent especially when&nbsp; Dave Grohl was at a low ebb in his music career. He even at a time cut off communication with Jordyn but he soon had a turning point when his bandmate Taylor Hawkins suffered a drug overdose. It was at this point that Dave sought to get things right in his life and thank goodness, Jordyn was right there to help him through.</p><h2><strong>Jordyn Blum Has Been David Grohl’s Wife For 20 Years and They are Blessed With 3 Children</strong></h2><p>The marriage betweeen David and Jordyn has lasted for 20 years and still counting. The couple dated for a year before they got married on 2nd August 2003 in a private wedding ceremony that was only attended by their family members and a few friends. They have remained married since then and so far, their union has been an epitome of what a celebrity marriage should be, especially in Hollywood; an industry fraught with marriage scandals and rife with divorces.</p><p>They had their first child, a baby girl they named Violet Maye Grohl sometime in 2006. Harper Willow Grohl, their second child, also a girl, came in 2009 while their youngest child, another girl named Ophelia Saint Grohl, was born precisely on the 8th of August 2014.</p><p>Violet is aged 17 while Harper is 14 years old. The youngest Grohl child Ophelia is 5 years old. Considering their ages, the girls are still young to begin carving out careers for themselves and more so, their parents do not give much insight into what goes in their private tender lives and it is understandable why it is so.</p><p>Perhaps as they get older, we will learn a lot more about what they are going into careerwise and even their personal lives.</p><h3><strong>Jordyn Blum’s Height and Other Body Stats</strong></h3><p>Jordyn Blum stands tall at 5 feet 7 inches which is the equivalent of 170 cm. At such a decent height for a woman, Jordyn stands only 2 inches shorter than the average height of female models in America while her weight of 68 kg or 150 lbs tips over the average weight of female American models which is 51 kg or 113 lbs.</p><p>Considering that her modeling days are far gone, Jordyn still looks stunningly beautiful at her age and it is no fluke seeing that she ventured into modeling early on in her life. To complement her beauty, she has a slim body build, blue eyes, and blonde-colored hair.</p><h3><strong>Jordan Blum’s Social Media Presence</strong></h3><p>Jordan Blum has an Instagram page with the handle @jblumnyc. In the bio of the page, she describes herself as someone who is doing what she can to combat hate and judgment as the world needs more love, acceptance, and accountability.
