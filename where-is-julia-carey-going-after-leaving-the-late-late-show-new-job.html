She began working in the entertainment business as an actress.</p><p>Since then, she has left the spotlight and is now a show creator for businesses in Los Angeles.</p><p>Unlike her ever-popular other half, Julia avoids the internet and social media; nothing is known about her life outside her marriage.</p><p>She wed James Corden in 2012. The couple worked together on The Late Late Show for eight years.&nbsp;</p><p>After eight years of hard work, the couple leave The Late Late Show. So, where is Julia Carey going after leaving The Late Late Show?&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=james-cordens-wife-new-job-where-is-julia-carey-going></span>James Corden’s Wife New Job: Where Is Julia Carey Going?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>James and his wife Julia are leaving The Late Late Show.</p><p>After eight years, Corden declared that his final episode would air in the spring of 2023 and would leave The Late Late Show with his wife, Julia, in April 2022.</p><p>Since then, it has come to light that he left after serving for such a long time because he wanted to spend more time with his wife and their three children.</p><p>“I’ll be a complete disaster on that last show. He exclaimed, “I’m going to cry my eyes out,” in a Drew Barrymore Show episode.</p><p>But I’ll know that establishing roots in London is best for me and my family.

Cooper met Carey for the first time at a Save The Children fundraiser.</p><p>The night Carey and he spent getting to know one another, Corden said, was spent sitting in a corner.</p><p>An hour and a half after we first met, “we sat, and we very jokingly kind of planned the rest of our lives,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>The Mirror reported that the wedding cost more than $300,000 and included more than 200 guests.</p><p>Numerous of Corden’s famous friends, like David Beckham, Lara Stone, and Michael McIntyre, were present at the ceremony.</p><p>The couple engaged in 2010 and married in a splendid ceremony in 2012.</p><p>A source at the time stated: “James has been so overly thrilled about the wedding and wanted to ensure it was all they had envisioned.</p><p>It was just them two and their closest friends and family, and it was a wonderful day.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=julia-carey-and-james-corden-are-the-parents-of-three></span>Julia Carey And James Corden Are The Parents Of Three<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Corden couple has three children from their 14 years of togetherness.&nbsp;</p><p>In honor of Paul McCartney, their son Max McCartney Kimberley Corden received his first, middle name when he was born in March 2011. He and his Father both have the middle name Kimberley.</p><p>Carey, their daughter, was born in October 2014, shortly before the family moved from London to the United States and before Corden assumed the role of The Late Late Show presenter.</p><p>Of course, Carey bears her mother’s last name. In addition, daughter Charlotte was welcomed into the family in December 2017.</p><p>On the night of her birth, Corden was supposed to present his show, but he last-minutely requested a buddy, Harry Styles, to take over.</p><p>The following evening, Bryan Cranston took over as the couple spent time with their newborn.</p><p>The couple relocated to Los Angeles in 2014, shortly after the birth of their daughter Carey.</p><p>The TV presenter said, “All credit to my wife, who agreed to move when our daughter was five weeks old and our son was 3, and that is a massive undertaking,” to Ross King during an appearance on ITV’s Lorraine.</p><p>However, Corden told Deadline that he and his wife Carey “genuinely don’t know” if they will return from California to the U.K. when he announced in April 2022 that he would leave The Late Late Show in 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYmr%2BmecisZKOtnJ6ubq%2FAq5yyZZektq%2BzjJqdrZ2iYrmmrdWipaBlpJ2ybrjArZxmpJGpsm6%2Fx6iuZqaVrHqru8Fo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-are-harold-michaud-and-madeline-morel-alice-morel-michaud-parents.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Are Harold Michaud and Madeline Morel?
