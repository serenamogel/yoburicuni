Gus realized that joining the military was his greatest chance of avoiding a similar fate after his father died.</p><p>Melrose Bochy, on the other hand, grew up on a tobacco farm in North Carolina. When Bochy’s father was stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, she met him. Bruce is Gus Bochy’s third child, with two elder siblings, Joe and Terry, and one younger sibling, Mark.</p><p>Bruce is also married to Kim Seib, whom he met in college and later began dating. Kim and Bruce married in 1978 after dating for about three years. Brett and Greg Bochy are the couple’s two children. Both of his kids played baseball, with Greg playing for the San Diego Padres and Brett joining the San Francisco Giants in 2010. Both of his boys are now married with children of their own.</p><h2>Bruce Bochy Medical and Surgical Procedure</h2><p><strong>Bruce Bochy</strong> has had many surgical procedures to treat his heart and other body parts problems. Bochy had angioplasty in February 2015. Two stents were placed in his blood artery, which was 90% blocked.</p><p>Bochy was hospitalized again in 2016 owing to an abnormal heartbeat and underwent a cardioversion operation, which caused him to miss a game. After experiencing discomfort, he underwent a mild cardiac ablation. He had another ablation treatment after the game season. Bruce had back surgery, two hip replacements, and a knee replacement in addition to the heart surgery.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZq62Tmnqju8KhsGadpJ27qq%2FIrbBmppGptrC6wKWgrbFdrLansYycn6KklKeyr3nPmqmepqSofA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./eat-like-a-guy-fieri.html>&#171;&nbsp;Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives Locations in Illinois</a>
