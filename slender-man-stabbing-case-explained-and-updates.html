Leutner miraculously survived after crawling out of the woods for help.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Weier and Geyser later told investigators the attack was an attempted offering to the fictional internet character Slender Man, whom they believed would kill their families otherwise. The shocking details of the case and its connection to the urban legend drew national attention, with HBO airing a documentary titled <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.max.com/movies/beware-the-slenderman/7d311e1b-d7d1-4536-a612-68dedd60835e data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Beware the Slenderman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Beware the Slenderman</a> about the incident in 2017.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Here’s what you need to know about the attack and where Weier, Geyser, and Leutner are now.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A Friendship Gone Wrong</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">According to New York Magazine, Weier, Geyser, and Leutner <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2015/08/slender-man-stabbing.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="all began attending" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">all began attending</a> Horning Middle School in fall 2013. Weier and Geyser were socially isolated and found a lifeline in Leutner.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around this time, a friend introduced Weier to Creepypasta, a horror fan site where users created fake encyclopedia entries and other testimonials about fictional monsters and supernatural beings as if they were real. One of those was Slender Man—a tall, faceless entity initially created for a Photoshop contest. The character’s lore expanded through more posts on the site, eventually including his “pattern” of abducting children.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Weier began to believe Slender Man actually existed, and Geyser additionally became obsessed with the character—<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/morgan-geyser-makes-tearful-apology-is-handed-max-sentence-in-slender-man-stabbing/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she even believed" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she even believed</a> she had private, telepathic conversations with him.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">More True Crime</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Weier told investigators that Geyser proposed the idea of killing Leutner to become proxies of Slender Man in late December 2013 or early January of the following year. Geyser said Weier was the architect of the plan: “She made it seem necessary, and I figured that if it was necessary, then I would,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2015/08/slender-man-stabbing.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she explained" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she explained</a>.

They woke up in the morning, played dress-up, and ate breakfast before asking Geyser’s mother, Angie, if they could go outside to play. As Leutner walked ahead, Geyser secretly showed Weier the knife she had taken from her kitchen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Minutes later, the two girls carried out their plan. After leaving Leutner, they washed up at a nearby Walmart and wandered around Waukesha for a few hours before police found them sitting in the grass near the interstate.
