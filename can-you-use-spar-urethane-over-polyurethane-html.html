The majority of polyurethanes designed for outdoor applications will be oil-based. It is not recommended to try to apply an interior polyurethane outdoors since the finish will peel off quite rapidly.</p><h3><b>&nbsp;</b></h3><h3><b>Is it possible to apply spar urethane over stain?</b></h3><p>Member who is well-known. You may apply a spar urethane over water-based stains as long as the stain is totally dry before proceeding. Spar will stick to the fibres of the wood as well as the pores of the wood, sealing and protecting them.

If you apply each coat of finish in a decent length of time, there is no need to worry about it.
