If you’re not into fishy things, no worries, these wraps are completely vegan. If you are into fishy things, I think you’ll love them just the same – mashed chickpeas combined with salty, briny flavors (i.e. good Dijon mustard, capers, and cornichons) and…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Where did the name ‘Buddha Bowl’ come from, anyway? If you’ve been on Instagram in the last 5 years, chances are you’ve seen these colorful bowls, packed with plant-based goodness like grains, legumes, steamed and raw veggies, and flavorful sauces. According to a 2017 Epicurious article by Katherine Sacks, the name could come from how Buddha collected alms, using a large bowl to gather small bits of food that the residents of whatever village he was staying in could afford to share. Before we started calling these colorful bowls “Buddha Bowls,” I knew them as macro bowls.

I know, I know, the winter is not so bad here in Austin, but I feel for those of you up north, because I used to be one of you. I live for warm&nbsp;sunny days, so I made this cabbage salad of bright winter produce with you in mind – to send some love – and lemons…&nbsp;and well, also some clementines. What’s in this Cabbage Salad Recipe? This recipe includes two major categories of ingredients.

People who say “I was too busy, I forgot to eat lunch”… I don’t get you. But maybe I’m the only weirdo who&nbsp;eats breakfast and then immediately starts counting down the hours ’til&nbsp;lunch? This bowl was inspired by one&nbsp;ordinary day last week when I made a quick lunch for myself with kale, sweet potatoes, some other things I had on hand, and these&nbsp;Yves Kale & Quinoa Bites. It’s definitely an “I work from home” kind of lunch, but the whole thing…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Oh hi – long time no post. Last week, I was a bit sick and down for the count, to say the least.&nbsp;This week, I’m on a healing bender. I have my blender working overtime with&nbsp;crazy green smoothies made with ginger, turmeric and every herb that I’ve read about that contains immune-building qualities. I’m trying to eat lighter and brighter as well because I really do believe that plants can heal. Which brings me to this recipe from Blissful Basil, a cookbook that couldn’t have arrived at a better time.

My transition to eating healthier foods&nbsp;took a few years to settle in. As a busy college student, the foods from&nbsp;Amy’s&nbsp;Kitchen&nbsp;really helped me make this transition.&nbsp;I loved their Vegetable Lasagna, the Breakfast Burrito,&nbsp;and of course these&nbsp;Nacho Snacks.&nbsp;So when the folks at Amy’s reached out to me, I knew I wanted to make a recipe that incorporated these snacks in a slightly healthier holiday appetizer.

Technicalities aside, they work just as well for roasting and stuffing.&nbsp;Something I really love about my local Farmhouse Delivery is that&nbsp;vegetable varieties show up that even I&nbsp;– the girl that literally wrote&nbsp;a book about vegetables&nbsp;– have to occasionally Google. This recipe is comfort food on the lighter side.

In that recipe, I roasted the sprouts with a combination of balsamic vinegar and maple syrup. As a result, they became sweet and caramelized, with a great tang from the balsamic vinegar. This balsamic Brussels sprouts recipe starts in the same way, except that I roast the sprouts with&nbsp;onions. Then, when the veggies come out of the oven, I toss them with nutty farro to make a more substantial side dish.

This past weekend was full of&nbsp;food, wine, friends, and fun – but I’m definitely a little tired today and ready for a healthy eating reset. Not that this is rabbit food by any stretch – it’s full of roasted vegetables, nutty farro, roasted chickpeas, diced apples, cranberries… basically everything I love about fall in one hearty bowl. This one starts by roasting delicata squash and red onion wedges (btw, how pretty is this color combination?). To get the most out of my oven’s heat, I roasted chickpeas as well.

Jack and I have eaten there at least 2x per week since it opened. In fact, we’ve just returned from eating lunch there.
