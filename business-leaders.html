Zuckerberg left college after his sophomore year to concentrate on the site, the user base of which has grown to more than two billion people, making Zuckerberg a billionaire many times over. The birth of Facebook was portrayed in the 2010 film The Social Network.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, into a comfortable, well-educated family. He was raised in the nearby village of Dobbs Ferry.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zuckerberg’s father, Edward Zuckerberg, ran a dental practice attached to the family's home. His mother, Karen, worked as a psychiatrist before the birth of the couple's four children — Mark, Randi, Donna and Arielle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zuckerberg developed an interest in computers at an early age; when he was about 12, he used Atari BASIC to create a messaging program he named "Zucknet." His father used the program in his dental office, so that the receptionist could inform him of a new patient without yelling across the room. The family also used Zucknet to communicate within the house.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Together with his friends, he also created computer games just for fun. "I had a bunch of friends who were artists," he said. "They'd come over, draw stuff, and I'd build a game out of it."</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mark Zuckerberg’s Education</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To keep up with Zuckerberg's burgeoning interest in computers, his parents hired private computer tutor David Newman to come to the house once a week and work with Zuckerberg. Newman later told reporters that it was hard to stay ahead of the prodigy, who began taking graduate courses at nearby <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.mercy.edu/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mercy College" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Mercy College</a> around this same time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zuckerberg later studied at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.exeter.edu/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Phillips Exeter Academy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Phillips Exeter Academy</a>, an exclusive preparatory school in New Hampshire. There he showed talent in fencing, becoming the captain of the school's team. He also excelled in literature, earning a diploma in classics.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Yet Zuckerberg remained fascinated by computers and continued to work on developing new programs. While still in high school, he created an early version of the music software Pandora, which he called Synapse.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Several companies—including AOL and Microsoft—expressed an interest in buying the software, and hiring the teenager before graduation. He declined the offers.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mark Zuckerberg's College Experience</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduating from Exeter in 2002, Zuckerberg enrolled at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harvard.edu/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harvard University" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Harvard University</a>. After his sophomore year, Zuckerberg dropped out of college to devote himself to his new company, Facebook, full time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By his sophomore year at the Ivy League institution, he had developed a reputation as the go-to software developer on campus. It was at that time that he built a program called CourseMatch, which helped students choose their classes based on the course selections of other users.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He also invented Facemash, which compared the pictures of two students on campus and allowed users to vote on which one was more attractive. The program became wildly popular, but was later shut down by the school administration after it was deemed inappropriate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Based on the buzz of his previous projects, three of his fellow students—Divya Narendra, and twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss—sought him out to work on an idea for a social networking site they called Harvard Connection. This site was designed to use information from Harvard's student networks in order to create a dating site for the Harvard elite.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zuckerberg agreed to help with the project, but soon dropped out to work on his own social networking site, The Facebook.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mark Zuckerberg and Founding Facebook</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zuckerberg and his friends Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Eduardo Saverin created The Facebook, a site that allowed users to create their own profiles, upload photos, and communicate with other users. The group ran the site out of a dorm room at Harvard University until June 2004.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That year Zuckerberg dropped out of college and moved the company to Palo Alto, California. By the end of 2004, Facebook had 1 million users.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2005, Zuckerberg's enterprise received a huge boost from the venture capital firm Accel Partners. Accel invested $12.7 million into the network, which at the time was open only to Ivy League students.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zuckerberg's company then granted access to other colleges, high school and international schools, pushing the site's membership to more than 5.5 million users by December 2005. The site began attracting the interest of other companies that wanted to advertise with the popular social hub.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Not wanting to sell out, Zuckerberg turned down offers from companies such as Yahoo! and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.mtv.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="MTV Networks" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">MTV Networks</a>. Instead, he focused on expanding the site, opening up his project to outside developers and adding more features.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">‘Harvard Connection’ and Legal Hurdles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zuckerberg seemed to be going nowhere but up. However, in 2006, the business mogul faced his first big hurdle: the creators of Harvard Connection claimed that Zuckerberg stole their idea, and insisted the software developer needed to pay for their business losses.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zuckerberg maintained that the ideas were based on two very different types of social networks. After lawyers searched Zuckerberg's records, incriminating instant messages revealed that Zuckerberg may have intentionally stolen the intellectual property of Harvard Connection and offered Facebook users' private information to his friends.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zuckerberg later apologized for the incriminating messages, saying he regretted them. "If you're going to go on to build a service that is influential and that a lot of people rely on, then you need to be mature, right?" he said in an interview with The New Yorker. "I think I've grown and learned a lot."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although an initial settlement of $65 million was reached between the two parties, the legal dispute over the matter continued well into 2011, after Narendra and the Winklevosses claimed they were misled in regards to the value of their stock.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/cs_srgb,dpr_1.0,q_80/MTY2NjgyODgxMTMxODE2Mjg4/markzuckerberg_facts_desktop.jpg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S MARK ZUCKERBERG FACT CARD" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S MARK ZUCKERBERG FACT CARD</a></strong></p><img alt="Mark Zuckerberg Fact Card" title="Mark Zuckerberg Fact Card" width=600 height=1519 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/markzuckerberg_facts_desktop.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=35 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Social Network' Movie</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2010, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin’s movie The Social Network was released. The critically acclaimed film received eight Academy Award nominations.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sorkin’s screenplay was based on the 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires, by writer Ben Mezrich. Mezrich was heavily criticized for his re-telling of Zuckerberg's story, which used invented scenes, re-imagined dialogue and fictional characters.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zuckerberg objected strongly to the film's narrative, and later told a reporter at The New Yorker that many of the details in the film were inaccurate. For example, Zuckerberg had been dating his longtime girlfriend since 2003. He also said he was never interested in joining any of the final clubs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"It's interesting what stuff they focused on getting right; like, every single shirt and fleece that I had in that movie is actually a shirt or fleece that I own," Zuckerberg told a reporter at a startup conference in 2010. "So there's all this stuff that they got wrong and a bunch of random details that they got right."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Yet Zuckerberg and Facebook continued to succeed, in spite of the criticism. Time magazine named him Person of the Year in 2010, and Vanity Fair placed him at the top of their New Establishment list.</p><h2 data-node-id=41 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Facebook IPO</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In May 2012, Facebook had its initial public offering, which raised $16 billion, making it the biggest Internet IPO in history.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the initial success of the IPO, the Facebook stock price dropped somewhat in the early days of trading, though Zuckerberg is expected to weather any ups and downs in his company's market performance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2013, Facebook made the Fortune 500 list for the first time—making Zuckerberg, at the age of 28, the youngest CEO on the list.</p><h2 data-node-id=45 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Fake News and Cambridge Analytica Scandal</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zuckerberg was criticized for the proliferation of fake news posts on his site leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In early 2018, he announced a personal challenge to develop improved methods for defending Facebook users from abuse and interference by nation-states. (Previous personal challenges began in New Year's 2009 and have included only eating meat he killed himself and learning to speak Mandarin.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"We won't prevent all mistakes or abuse, but we currently make too many errors enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools," he wrote on his Facebook page. "If we're successful this year then we'll end 2018 on a much better trajectory."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zuckerberg came under fire again a few months later when it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm with ties to President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/donald-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Trump" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donald Trump</a>’s 2016 campaign, had used private information from approximately 87 million Facebook profiles without the social network alerting its owners. The resulting outcry seemed to shake investors' confidence in Facebook, its shares dropping by 15 percent after the news became public.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following a few days' silence, Zuckerberg surfaced on various outlets to explain how the company was taking steps to limit third-party developers' access to user information, and said he would be happy to testify before Congress.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On Sunday, March 25, Facebook took out full-page ads in seven British and three American newspapers, penned in the form of a personal apology from Zuckerberg. He promised the company would investigate all of its apps, and remind users which ones they can shut off. "I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time," he wrote. "I promise to do better for you."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Amid increasing calls for his resignation from investor groups, Zuckerberg traveled to Capitol Hill and met with lawmakers ahead of his two-day testimony, scheduled for April 10 and 11. The first day of hearings, with the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees, was considered a tame affair, with some senators seemingly struggling to understand the business model that powered the social media giant.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The follow-up hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee proved far testier, as its members grilled the Facebook CEO over privacy concerns. During the day's testimony, Zuckerberg revealed that his personal information was among the data harvested by Cambridge Analytica, and suggested that legal regulation of Facebook and other social media companies was "inevitable."</p><h2 data-node-id=53 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Wealth</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The negative PR around the 2016 election and Cambridge Analytica scandal seemingly did little to slow the company's progress: Facebook saw its stock close at a record $203.23 on July 6, 2018. The surge bumped Zuckerberg past Berkshire Hathaway chief Warren Buffett to become the world's third-richest person, behind fellow tech titans <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/jeff-bezos data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jeff Bezos" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jeff Bezos</a> and Bill Gates.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Any gains were wiped out when Facebook shares dropped a staggering 19 percent on July 26, following an earnings report that revealed a failure to meet revenue expectations and slowing user growth. Nearly $16 billion of Zuckerberg's personal fortune was erased in one day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The stock rebounded, and Zuckerberg remains one of the world's wealthiest people. In 2019, Forbes ranked Zuckerberg at No. 8 on its ‘Billionaires’ list—behind <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/bill-gates data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Microsoft founder Bill Gates" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Microsoft founder Bill Gates</a> (No. 2) and ahead of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/larry-page data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Google co-founders Larry Page" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Google co-founders Larry Page</a> (No. 10) and Sergey Brin (No. 14). The magazine estimated his net worth to be about $62.3 billion at the time.</p><h2 data-node-id=57 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Libra</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In June 2019, Facebook announced it was getting into the cryptocurrency business with the planned launch of Libra in 2020. Along with developing the blockchain technology to power its financial infrastructure, Facebook established a Switzerland-based oversight entity called the Libra Association, comprised of tech giants like Spotify and venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The news again put Zuckerberg in the crosshairs of Congress, which summoned the CEO to testify before the House Financial Service Committee in October. Despite providing assurances that Facebook would withdraw from the Libra Association if the project failed to garner approval from regulators, Zuckerberg faced pointed questioning from skeptical lawmakers who cited the Cambridge Analytica fiasco and other past transgressions.</p><h2 data-node-id=60 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mark Zuckerberg’s Wife</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=61 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zuckerberg has been married to Priscilla Chan, a Chinese-American medical student he met at Harvard, since 2012. The longtime couple tied the knot one day after Facebook’s IPO.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=62 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">About 100 people gathered at the couple's Palo Alto, California home for the ceremony. The guests thought they were there to celebrate Chan's graduation from medical school, but instead they witnessed Zuckerberg and Chan exchange vows.</p><h2 data-node-id=63 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mark Zuckerberg’s Daughters</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=64 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zuckerberg has two daughters, Max, born on November 30, 2015, and August, born on August 28, 2017.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=65 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The couple announced they were expecting both of their children on Facebook.
