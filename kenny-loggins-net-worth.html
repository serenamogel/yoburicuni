Washington, is the youngest of three brothers.</p><p>His mother, Lina, was a homemaker, and his father, Robert George Loggins, worked as a salesman.</p><p>The family initially lived in Detroit before settling in Alhambra, California.</p><p>After graduating from San Gabriel Mission High School in 1966, Kenny Loggins pursued his passion for music, forming his first band called The Second Helping.</p><p>They released three singles between 1968 and 1969 under Viva Records, known for their “punky folk-pop” style.</p><p>Before joining the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Loggins briefly played

(1997), and “December” (1998).</p><p>In 1994, he ventured into children’s music with the release of “Return to Pooh Corner” and followed it up with “More Songs from Pooh Corner” in 2000.</p><p>In 2005, Loggins and Messina reunited for a triumphant tour, album, and concert video.</p><p>After two years, Loggins released “How About Now,” marking his first solo album in four years, followed by “All Join In” in 2009.</p><p>With a career spanning three decades, Loggins still occasionally performs and records music.</p><p>He’s also a member of Blue Sky Riders, a country music trio that includes Gary Burr and Georgia Middleman.</p><p>The group released their debut album, “Finally Home,” in January 2013.</p><p>As for Kenny Loggins’ net worth, it has been shaped by his illustrious career in music, spanning both group and solo endeavours.</p><h2><span id=Kenny_Loggins_Career_Awards_And_Nominations>Kenny Loggins Career Awards And Nominations</span></h2><p>At the height of his
