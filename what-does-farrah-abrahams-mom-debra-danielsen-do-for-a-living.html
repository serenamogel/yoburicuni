So… what does Debra Danielsen do for a living?</p><p>Oddly enough, according to her online resume, the answer for the last few years is “talent” for ViaCom. In other words, cast member on 16 and Pregnant and Teen Mom. But don’t let that fool you! Debra’s got skillz y’all!

Wait, what?</p><p>But wait! If you were intimidated by Debra’s academic endeavors, just wait until you catch up on her work history! Here it is, starting with her present gig with MTV and working backwards. (Although she seems to have left out her most recent endeavor with Farrah on the Mom & Me brand of food products.)
