If my vote ends up being the difference between lynch wagons, or gets exploited because I cannot change it, that hurts town far more than sticking to my hunches.<br>If I am 100% certain and have concrete evidence that a player is scum, I will leave my vote up over Sabbath, but this is D1, and I've just got a bunch of questions and a headache.</p>Aside from that, I "got called out" on the day that I couldn't come back and defend myself until potentially after the phase had ended, so...<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bulbagarden.net/data:image/gif;base64 alt=:p title="Stick Out Tongue :p" data-shortname=:p style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><p>i don't see enough of a change on Space to say “yea I townread them hard enough to let them scoot by”.</p>Not sure if this was addressed to me or in general. I've mentioned multiple times at this point that, yes there wasn't a massive change in my thinking regarding Space that would have prompted an "unvote" under most circumstances, but there also wasn't enough of a change in my thoughts or a strong enough conviction to warrant leaving an immutable vote up for 20ish hours of the phase that could be the difference between lynch wagons.<p>Now, regarding Space...<br></p><p>that's what weirded me out about his readlist. he put himself as scum, then others, but how do we take that seriously?</p>She claims that she can't take my readslist seriously because I put myself as scum.<br>First of all, numerous players like Midorikawa, Elieson, and Zexy have done the same thing.<br>Second of all, I didn't actually say that I was scum in my readslist this time<br><p>12. ME: An idiot with a box and a screwdriver. Way too noisy and egotistical. Why is he even in this game? He should go back into retirement.</p><a href=# class=username data-xf-init=member-tooltip data-user-id=85760 data-username=@Space>@Space</a> where and how does the above even remotely come across as saying that I'm scum?<p>Space’s votes don’t come off as opportunistic for me, I can see how they make sense. Who do you think she should have voted for instead?</p>It's not a matter of thinking that she should vote for a different slot, necessarily. It's a combination of the innate self-preservation of the vote, combined with her reasoning:<p>I do agree that it feels wrong to judge a sub based on the previous player, but at the same time, it kind of has to be done. We can't pretend we never saw Fatima's posts</p><p>honestly feel this is the best we have to go on at the moment. I feel strange about it given the sub in, but as I said, Fatima's posts can't be unseen</p>Yes, we can't ignore Fatima's posts, but voting for ExLight <i>at this point in the game</i>, for reasons that he cannot defend himself against...it seems a little scummy.<br>Especially since, by this point in the game, ExLight had already done plenty, and, IMO, there were, and still are, valid reasons to vote for ExLight.<br>Space, instead, chooses to vote, basically, for Fatima.<br>Yes, I know it's the same slot, but I hope you understand what I'm saying.<p>An interesting thought on ExLight is that he said this fairly early on:<br></p><p>a cop check should prove that but I guess there's the possibility of everyone being paranoid of godfather lol<br>lie detector on this could work too if anyone has it</p>I feel like, if Ex is Mafia, there's a very good chance that he is Godfather. He brings up both Cop and Lie Detector as a means of clearing him on N1, and, while the Lie Detector may seem like a bold way for scum to ask to be cleared...but there is also almost certainly a Cop in pretty much every non-Vanilla/Goon only setup, and a Lie Detector in a game this small is probably broken.<p>It's also interesting that Ex is concerned about his role not flipping properly.<br></p><p>Once you start playing in like seven forums the culture of them start getting mixed up lol<br>And I mean, better safe than sorry</p>I can sort of believe this explanation, but something still smells slightly off about it.<br><span class=button-text><span>Spoiler</span></span> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bulbagarden.net/attachments/1625408041665-png.146861/ data-url data-zoom-target=1 alt=1625408041665.png title=1625408041665.png width=639 height=480 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>In any case, since the wagons would no longer be tied, and since my case on Space is still the strongest one I have, I'm going to <b>Vote: Space</b>.<p>If it looks like there is going to be a tie, I will remove or switch my vote toward EoD.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyzrcinmaivXae8pLfErWSmmZaerm6xzZ2emqWVYr%2Bitc2bprBloqSwrLHTZp%2Baq12nsqKvx56bZqeil7a1edOorqdlkaOxbrXNnZypnZ6Zsq%2FAjK%2BgnKyfp8ZvfpdvbnFoX6WuqLGManA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-joseph-bankman-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Joseph Bankman?
