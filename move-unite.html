In addition, <a href=#>Unite Moves</a> are powerful moves unique to Pokémon UNITE.</p><p>Moves have one or two of several different categories, which loosely describes their general function. After being used, a move cannot be used again until its cooldown has passed.</p><p>Related, but separate from moves are <a href=# title="Basic attack">basic attacks</a>. Every Pokémon has access to a basic attack. These attacks are weaker than moves, but do not have cooldowns.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Categories>Categories</span></h2><p>Moves are split into different categories, consisting of Melee, Dash, Ranged, Sure Hit, Area, Buff, Debuff, Hindrance, and Recovery. Each move usually has one category, which serves to generally describe the move's overall effect. Some moves have more than one category and the categories themselves have quite a bit of overlap in their definitions.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt="UNITE Skill Label Melee.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/8/83/UNITE_Skill_Label_Melee.png/30px-UNITE_Skill_Label_Melee.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Melee Melee moves generally damage opposing Pokémon in front of the user. <a href=# class=image><img alt="UNITE Skill Label Dash.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/9/9a/UNITE_Skill_Label_Dash.png/30px-UNITE_Skill_Label_Dash.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Dash Dash moves generally involve causing the user to move to a specific area or in a designated direction. Often, these moves allow their user to pass through obstacles, so long as the move does not end with the user within an obstacle. (Most Dash moves will not allow the user to move into an obstacle that the move will end on, leaving the user just outside of the obstacle if attempted. Moves such as <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Fly>Fly</a> that involve free movement are allowed to end within obstacles but the user is automatically relocated to a space just beyond the obstacle) Some Dash moves do not deal damage. Those moves are exclusively movement tools. This includes some attacks that normally inflict damage in the core series, such as <a href=# title="Dragapult (UNITE)">Dragapult</a>'s <a href=# title="Quick Attack (move)">Quick Attack</a>. <a href=# class=image><img alt="UNITE Skill Label Ranged.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/9/9e/UNITE_Skill_Label_Ranged.png/30px-UNITE_Skill_Label_Ranged.png decoding=async width=20 height=21 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Ranged Ranged moves generally have a longer or larger range compared to Melee moves. Sometimes, they involve the user launching one or more projectiles into an area or in a direction. <a href=# class=image><img alt="UNITE Skill Label Sure Hit.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/e/e3/UNITE_Skill_Label_Sure_Hit.png/30px-UNITE_Skill_Label_Sure_Hit.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Sure Hit Sure Hit moves are generally moves which target an opposing Pokémon rather than an area or a direction. Once this kind of move is performed, the move attempts to track opponents so as to hit them even if the opponent moves out of the move's initial range. Some Sure Hit moves involve attacks with long ranges, while others are close range attacks where the user moves directly to the target (selected from a larger range) before striking. <a href=# class=image><img alt="UNITE Skill Label Area.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/b/b8/UNITE_Skill_Label_Area.png/30px-UNITE_Skill_Label_Area.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Area Area moves hit in an area located around the user. This area is not necessarily circular, nor is it centered on the user. <a href=# class=image><img alt="UNITE Skill Label Recovery.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/d/d8/UNITE_Skill_Label_Recovery.png/30px-UNITE_Skill_Label_Recovery.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Recovery Recovery moves allow the user or the user and their allies to recover <a href=# title=HP>HP</a>. <a href=# class=image><img alt="UNITE Skill Label Buff.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/0/05/UNITE_Skill_Label_Buff.png/30px-UNITE_Skill_Label_Buff.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Buff Buff moves give the user of the move or the user and their allies a beneficial effect, such as increasing their stats, creating <a href=# class=new title="Shield (UNITE) (page does not exist)">shields</a>, or allow a Pokémon's <a href=# title=Ability>Ability</a> to be activated more easily. Some of these moves create additional objects that interact with other Pokémon. <a href=# class=image><img alt="UNITE Skill Label Debuff.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/8/8e/UNITE_Skill_Label_Debuff.png/30px-UNITE_Skill_Label_Debuff.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Debuff The counterpoint of Buff moves, Debuff moves generally weaken opposing Pokémon by reducing their stats. <a href=# class=image><img alt="UNITE Skill Label Hindrance.png" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/4/4a/UNITE_Skill_Label_Hindrance.png/30px-UNITE_Skill_Label_Hindrance.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Hindrance Hindrance moves are moves that can inflict <a href=# class=new title="Hindrance (page does not exist)">hindrances</a> on opposing Pokémon. Generally, hindrances prevent opposing Pokémon from taking certain actions for a (usually short) period of time.<h2><span class=mw-headline id=Mechanics>Mechanics</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Input>Input</span></h3><p>Each move has an icon, and on the <a href=# title="Nintendo Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> version an associated button. Using a move is done by pressing and releasing the icon on a mobile version or the button on the Switch version. Since moves are usually initiated only upon releasing the input, there is an opportunity for the player to reconsider using a move before releasing the input. A move can be cancelled by a pressing a dedicated cancel button before releasing the move's button on the Switch version or by dragging one's finger over to the cancel icon before lifting their finger from the screen. This prevents the Pokémon from using the move. This is a valuable tool because using a move against no other Pokémon still causes the move to enter its <a href=#>cooldown</a>.</p><p>While the input for a move is held, the range of the move is indicated to the user by a blue shape projected on the ground. More complex moves indicate additional information through their projections. For instance, <a href=# title="Zoroark (UNITE)">Zoroark</a>'s <a href=# title="Shadow Claw (move)">Shadow Claw</a> and <a href=# title="Goodra (UNITE)">Goodra</a>'s <a href=# title="Power Whip (move)">Power Whip</a> have additional effects when they hit at the edge of their maximum range, and the bounding box for that is overlaid on top of the shape for the move's overall range. Some moves additionally incorporate arrows into their visual aids. <a href=# title="Tsareena (UNITE)">Tsareena</a>'s <a href=# title="Grassy Glide (move)">Grassy Glide</a> indicates the area of effect of the kick at the end of the attack with a square with an arrow pattern inlaid. This indicates the direction that the kick, and the direction that kick knocks opponents into.</p><p>By default, moves that designate a direction or target are aimed at the nearest opposing Pokémon or directly forward if there is no opponent. Moves that designate an area aim at the nearest opposing Pokémon as well, but in the absence of that select the area around the user. The direction, target, or area can be manually changed while holding the move's input. Moves that designate a target select their target from a circular sector of their range, and cannot be performed if there are no targets in that sector; the text "No Target" briefly appears if a move could not be used due to this restriction.</p><p>Some moves, like <a href=# title="Slowpoke (Pokémon)">Slowpoke</a>'s <a href=# title="Water Gun (move)">Water Gun</a> and <a href=# title="Kubfu (Pokémon)">Kubfu</a>'s <a href=# title="Rock Smash (move)">Rock Smash</a>, are charged while holding down their input. For these moves, a yellow bar appears over the user, and fills up over time. Moves can have different effects when they are charged in this manner, usually becoming stronger. (Usually, there is a breaking point at halfway through the bar where the move has gained the maximum benefit from being charged) However, when the yellow bar reaches its maximum, the move is not performed at all. Instead, the move enters <a href=#>cooldown</a> for a certain amount of time. (Usually, it is one second.) These moves can still be cancelled normally, but this also incurs this cooldown.</p><p>Certain moves, such as <a href=# title="Blastoise (Pokémon)">Blastoise</a>'s <a href=# title="Water Spout (move)">Water Spout</a> while using <a href=# title="Rapid Spin (move)">Rapid Spin</a> and <a href=# title="Gyarados (Pokémon)">Gyarados</a>'s <a href=# title="Aqua Tail (move)">Aqua Tail</a>, have an effect that lasts for an extended period of time, but only as long as the input is held down. The amount of time the effects of these moves can last is indicated by an orange bar that starts filled and diminishes the longer the input is held until it disappears, causing the move to end. Moves that work in this manner can be ended early either by releasing the input or by using the cancel input. These moves only enter cooldown once the move ends.</p><p>When a Pokémon is taking certain actions, such as a launch from a <a href=# class=new title="Springboard (page does not exist)">springboard</a>, or when a Pokémon is affected by most kinds of <a href=# class=new title="Hindrance (UNITE) (page does not exist)">hindrances</a>, moves cannot be used. In these cases, the move's icon will be greyed out and a cancel symbol will appear over the icon.</p><p>If the "Camera Follows Moves" option is toggled on, the camera will shift in the direction a move is being aimed in, should its direction not be entirely on screen with the default camera position. It is off by default. Moves that designate areas always do this regardless of setting</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Lock-On>Lock-On</span></h3><p>The direction, area, or target a move aims at by default depends on the player's Control Settings. This is based on the Opponent Lock-On Priority setting.</p><p>Depending on the setting, the Pokémon that determines the default aim can be the opposing Pokémon with the least <a href=# title=HP>HP</a>, the least percentage of remaining HP, or the closest opponent. Pokémon on the opposing team are prioritized over <a href=# title="Wild Pokémon">wild Pokémon</a>. Opposing Pokémon hidden via <a href=# class=new title="Stealth (UNITE) (page does not exist)">Stealth</a> or <a href=# title="Tall grass">Tall grass</a> do not influence move aim, nor do opponents who cannot be seen because the user is under the effects of <a href=# class=new title="Condition (UNITE) (page does not exist)">Vision Obscured</a>.</p><p>When the "Automatically Lock-On to Targets" setting is on (it is by default), a move will have its aim snap to and continuously follow a target within range. If the player aims the move manually, this will be disabled for the duration of using that move.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Move_properties>Move properties</span></h3><p>Moves can deal <a href=# title="Physical move">Attack-based damage</a> or <a href=# title="Special move">Sp. Atk-based damage</a>, where Attack-based damage is calculated using <a href=# title=Stat>Attack</a> stat of the user and the <a href=# title=Stat>Defense</a> stat of the Pokémon that are hit while Sp. Atk-based damage uses the <a href=# title=Stat>Special Attack</a> stat of the user and the <a href=# title=Stat>Special Defense</a> stat of the Pokémon that are hit. However, unlike what is seen in the <a href=# title="Core series">core series</a>, a move does not determine the kind of damage it deals. Pokémon are either Attack Pokémon or Sp. Atk Pokémon, and this property determines the damage that their moves deal. For instance, <a href=# title="Charizard (UNITE)">Charizard</a> is an Attack Pokémon, so all of its moves deal Attack-based damage. This includes its <a href=# title="Flamethrower (move)">Flamethrower</a>, which would be a <a href=# title="Special move">Special move</a> in the core series. Conversely, <a href=# title="Chandelure (UNITE)">Chandelure</a> is a Sp. Atk Pokémon, so all of its moves inflict Sp. Atk-based damage, including its Flamethrower.</p><p>Certain moves, such as <a href=# title="Zoroark (UNITE)">Zoroark</a>'s <a href=# title="Feint Attack (move)">Feint Attack</a> operate differently in certain situations, essentially being a second move that shares the same name and cooldown as the original. In some cases, this is caused by using a singular move multiple times, as with Feint Attack. Sometimes, moves changing in this way is described as a boosted version of the move, as with <a href=# title="Miraidon (UNITE)">Miraidon</a>'s <a href=# title="Charge Beam (move)">Charge Beam</a> and <a href=# title="Electro Drift (move)">Electro Drift</a>.</p><p>Certain moves, such as <a href=# title="Venusaur (UNITE)">Venusaur</a>'s <a href=# title="Petal Dance (move)">Petal Dance</a> and <a href=# title="Eldegoss (UNITE)">Eldegoss</a>'s <a href=# title="Cotton Spore (move)">Cotton Spore</a>, have effects that last for a certain amount of time after using the move but are not tied to the move's effect duration. For these moves, an orange bar is displayed above the user. The bar represents how long the move's effect will last, either filling up or starting full and diminishing as the move's effect is active and disappearing after reaching its maximum or minimum which is when the move concludes. Notably, <a href=#>cooldowns</a> start counting down when the move is activated, and not when the effect ends. This means that, if the cooldown for this kind of move is reduced to a small enough timer or otherwise skipped, the move can be used again while its effect is still running. This refreshes the effect of the move. This can have additional nifty properties. For instance, reusing <a href=# title="Dragonite (UNITE)">Dragonite</a>'s <a href=# title="Outrage (move)">Outrage</a> in this way means it never gets <a href=# class=new title="Hindrance (page does not exist)">immobilized</a> at the end of the move because the move does not end. (This oddity can only happen in modes with reduced cooldowns, such as in a <a href=# title="Mer Stadium">Full Fury Battle</a>, through use of <a href=# class=new title="Shivre City (Panic Parade) (page does not exist)">Panic Parade's Aeos Shooter boosts</a>, or by turning off move cooldowns in the <a href=# title="Theia Sky Ruins">Practice Area</a>.)</p><p>Some moves allow for using a different move or <a href=# title="Basic attack">basic attack</a> during their duration. In some cases, like <a href=# title="Zeraora (UNITE)">Zeraora</a>'s <a href=# title="Spark (move)">Spark</a> or <a href=# title="Zoroark (UNITE)">Zoroark</a>'s <a href=# title="Night Slash (move)">Night Slash</a> and <a href=# title="Shadow Claw (move)">Shadow Claw</a>/<a href=# title="Cut (move)">Cut</a>, this can modify the effect of the first move. In other cases, like <a href=# title="Garchomp (UNITE)">Garchomp</a>'s <a href=# title="Dragon Rush (move)">Dragon Rush</a> and <a href=# title="Dragon Claw (move)">Dragon Claw</a>, this combines the effects of both moves into a single maneuver.</p><p>Some moves, such as <a href=# title="Dragapult (UNITE)">Dragapult</a>'s <a href=# title="Dragon Dance (move)">Dragon Dance</a>, modify the properties of the user's <a href=# title="Basic attack">basic attack</a>. Some moves change what a basic attack does, such as how <a href=# title="Clefable (UNITE)">Clefable</a> uses a different basic attack while under the effect of its <a href=# title="Gravity (move)">Gravity</a>. Other moves, such as <a href=# title="Azumarill (UNITE)">Azumarill</a>'s <a href=# title="Play Rough (move)">Play Rough</a> and <a href=# title="Aqua Tail (move)">Aqua Tail</a>, change their user's basic attacks in lieu of attacking when the move is used. <a href=# title="Duraludon (UNITE)">Duraludon</a>'s <a href=# title="Flash Cannon (move)">Flash Cannon</a> is a move that both has an initial attack, then further modifies the user's basic attacks.</p><p>Some moves, such as <a href=# title="Dragapult (UNITE)">Dragapult</a>'s <a href=# title="Shadow Ball (move)">Shadow Ball</a> and <a href=# title="Azumarill (UNITE)">Azumarill</a>'s <a href=# title="Water Pulse (move)">Water Pulse</a>, allow the user to move a short distance in a designated direction right after using the move. This is something of a "dodge roll", giving these Pokémon an extra bit of maneuverability they can utilize while in combat. This follows the currently inputted direction on the control stick/touchscreen, with the movement being skipped if no direction is designated.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Cooldown_and_uses>Cooldown and uses</span></h3><p>After being used, each move goes through a cooldown period. During this cooldown period, the move is unable to be used. Some Pokemon have effects that can reduce the time a move spends in cooldown or skip a cooldown period entirely. Cooldowns are measured in seconds.</p><p>For moves that can be charged, cancelling them or charging them for too long incurs a one second cooldown for that move.</p><p>Some moves can have multiple uses stored up at once. Activating these moves only spends one of their uses, and the uses for those moves regenerate over time. These moves only fully enter cooldown when all uses have been spent. This is distinct from moves that can be used multiple times, as stored uses are not required to be spent within an effect duration.</p><p>Some moves have an effect duration period they go through before entering cooldown. This effect duration is used by other effects relating to that move. The majority of effect durations are tied to a move's continuous effect, and in those cases using the move during its effect duration concludes the move early. In multiple other cases, a move can be used more than one time before it enters cooldown. The effect duration indicates the amount of time available to make use of these additional uses before the move enters cooldown. If this happens, the remaining uses are essentially lost. In the case of moves being usable more than twice in this way, the effect duration resets between uses of the move. Once all available uses have been used, the move will simply enter the cooldown period.</p><p>In some cases, inputting a move for a second time during its effect duration initiates a second step of the move. Two examples of this are <a href=# title="Mew (UNITE)">Mew</a> being allowed to pick up a <a href=# title="Light Screen (move)">Light Screen</a> that it has placed and <a href=# title="Meowscarada (UNITE)">Meowscarada</a> swapping places with the copy of itself during <a href=# title="Double Team (move)">Double Team</a>.</p><p>Note that if a Pokémon initiates a move but does not complete the move (likely because it was afflicted with a <a href=# class=new title="Hindrance (UNITE) (page does not exist)">hindrance</a> of some kind during the animation, the move will still enter cooldown. Some moves cause their user to become <a href=# class=new title="Condition (UNITE) (page does not exist)">unstoppable</a> for their duration, which renders them immune to hindrances and therefore this mechanic.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Move_variations>Move variations</span></h3><p>While moves in UNITE are based on moves from the core series and generally adhere to the concept of the move, a move can have different effects depending on which Pokémon knows the move. For instance, all variations on <a href=# title="Surf (move)">Surf</a> involve the user attacking with a wave of water. However, <a href=# title="Slowbro (UNITE)">Slowbro</a>'s, <a href=# title="Blastoise (UNITE)">Blastoise</a>'s, <a href=# title="Greninja (UNITE)">Greninja</a>'s, and <a href=# title="Mew (UNITE)">Mew</a>'s Surf have the user ride the wave of water forward while <a href=# title="Cramorant (UNITE)">Cramorant</a>'s Surf sends a wave out at opponents that returns at the end of its range. Even among move uses that are similar, different Pokémon have different effects for their moves. Slowbro's Surf is a Hindrance move that <a href=# class=new title="Hindrance (UNITE) (page does not exist)">throws</a> opposing Pokémon and is followed by two waves washing over the same area as the first, while Blastoise's Surf is a Dash move that shoves and <a href=# class=new title="Hindrance (UNITE) (page does not exist)">stuns</a> opposing Pokémon and allows Blastoise to hop off of the wave as the attack ends.</p><p>As mentioned under <a href=#>#Move properties</a>, the same move can inflict Attack-based damage or Sp. Atk-based damage depending on its user.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Learning_moves>Learning moves</span></h3><p>Each playable Pokémon can know a maximum of three moves at any given time; one of these moves is their Unite Move, while the other two are standard moves. At <a href=# title=Level>level</a> 1, a Pokémon learns one of two moves, deferring learning the second move until they reach a level of 2 or 3. After reaching a specific, higher level (ranging from 4 to 7), the Pokémon learns its choice of one of two moves to replace one of the moves it learned at level 1 or 3. The other move of that choice cannot be learned for the rest of the battle. The new moves can only replace the move that they are associated with. For instance, at Level 4, <a href=# title="Pikachu (UNITE)">Pikachu</a> learns either <a href=# title="Electro Ball (move)">Electro Ball</a> or <a href=# title="Thunder (move)">Thunder</a>, but those moves can only replace its <a href=# title="Thunder Shock (move)">Thunder Shock</a>. Generally, the new moves are improved versions of the move they are replacing. However, in some cases, such as with <a href=# title="Eldegoss (UNITE)">Eldegoss</a>, the moves that replace a move can have unrelated effects. Sometime during the range of Level 6 through 9, the same process occurs again, but for the move that was not replaced in the Level 4 to 7 range. To continue the example, Pikachu learns either <a href=# title="Volt Tackle (move)">Volt Tackle</a> or <a href=# title="Thunderbolt (move)">Thunderbolt</a>, but only to replace the other move it knew at Level 3, <a href=# title="Electroweb (move)">Electroweb</a>. At even higher levels, the moves that a Pokémon knows are upgraded into a <b>+</b> version which is better than the base move in some manner. <b>+</b> moves may deal more damage, increase the potency of the buffs they provide, reduce the time the move spends in cooldown, or provide other effects.</p><p>When a Pokémon is learning a move, a menu will appear allowing for a choice to be made. If a choice is not provided within a certain time frame, the game will automatically pick a move. For the Level 1/2/3 moves, the decision on which move to learn first is determined by the species of the Pokémon. For the moves learned at higher levels, the decision is also determined by the species but can be overridden by the player by choosing a particular move to be "Auto-set" from the menu for that Pokémon. Despite not involving a choice, an input must be made or a timer waited through in order for a Pokémon to upgrade a move or learn their Unite Move.</p><p>A move can still be used while a move is being learned to replace it. In some cases, usually involving moves with complex functionality like <a href=# title="Miraidon (UNITE)">Miraidon</a>'s <a href=# title="Charge Beam (move)">Charge Beam</a> and <a href=# title="Electro Drift (move)">Electro Drift</a>, a move cannot be upgraded to the + version while the move is in certain special states.</p><p>Some moves will have an effect just by being learned, without it being used. One case is <a href=# title="Dragapult (UNITE)">Dragapult</a>'s <a href=# title="Phantom Force (move)">Phantom Force</a>. Upon learning the move, it will receive a permanent attack buff and reset the cooldown on Phantom Force whenever it <a href=# class=new title="Knock Out (verb) (page does not exist)">knocks out</a> Pokémon from the opposing team. In some cases, like with <a href=# title="Duraludon (UNITE)">Duraludon</a>'s <a href=# title="Dragon Pulse (move)">Dragon Pulse</a>, this effect is tied into the functionality of the move. Just learning Dragon Pulse causes all of Duraludon's other attacks to mark opposing Pokémon. Then, Dragon Pulse removes those marks to deal increased damage against marked targets. <a href=# title="Blissey (UNITE)">Blissey</a> presents a peculiar third grouping, as their <a href=# title="Egg Bomb (move)">Egg Bomb</a> and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Softboiled (move)">Softboiled</a> are linked. Both moves share the number of uses they have. While learning one of the two moves means maximum maximum number of uses that can be kept in reserve is only two, learning both moves boosts this number up to four.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Special_cases>Special cases</span></h4><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/d/d7/UNITE_Mew_Move_Reset.png decoding=async width=100 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Move Reset icon<p>For the Pokémon <a href=# title="Scizor (UNITE)">Scyther</a> and <a href=# title="Urshifu (UNITE)">Kubfu</a>, learning specific moves is tied to their <a href=# title=Evolution>evolution</a>. Kubfu evolves into <a href=# title="Urshifu (Pokémon)">Single Strike Style</a> Urshifu by learning <a href=# title="Wicked Blow (move)">Wicked Blow</a> over its <a href=# title="Rock Smash (move)">Rock Smash</a> or <a href=# title="Urshifu (Pokémon)">Rapid Strike Style</a> Urshifu by learning <a href=# title="Surging Strikes (move)">Surging Strikes</a> over Rock Smash. Each Urshifu form learns a singular different move to replace <a href=# title="Headbutt (move)">Headbutt</a>, preventing the player from making a choice at that junction. Scyther evolves into Scizor if it learns <a href=# title="Bullet Punch (move)">Bullet Punch</a> and forgets <a href=# title="Fury Cutter (move)">Fury Cutter</a>, but will not evolve at all if it learns <a href=# title="Dual Wingbeat (move)">Dual Wingbeat</a> instead. For these Pokémon, their evolution is delayed until the decision regarding the move learned is made.</p><p><a href=# title="Mew (UNITE)">Mew</a> in Pokémon UNITE is an exception to the process of learning moves. Instead of the above process, Mew has the choice of learning one move out of three options at Level 1 and a second choice of one move out of three different options at Level 3. At Level 5, Mew gains a unique icon, <b>Move Reset</b>, which allows it to forget all of the non-Unite Moves it knows. At this point, Mew can re-select the moves it wishes to learn, and is allowed to make different decisions each time it uses Move Reset.</p><p>Another unique case is <a href=# title="Blaziken (UNITE)">Blaziken</a>, who is given only one option to replace its two starting moves, those being <a href=# title="Blaze Kick (move)">Blaze Kick</a> and <a href=# title="Overheat (move)">Overheat</a> respectively replacing <a href=# title="Ember (move)">Ember</a> and <a href=# title="Aerial Ace (move)">Aerial Ace</a>. In return, Blaziken's Unite Move has a unique property in that it allows it to completely switch both of its moves with its other set of moves at will, with the original move set being referred to as the Kick Style and its other move set, <a href=# title="Fire Punch (move)">Fire Punch</a> and <a href=# title="Focus Blast (move)">Focus Blast</a>, being referred to as the Punch Style. Swapping between the Punch and Kick Styles also changes the properties of Blaziken's basic attacks and Unite Move.</p><p><a href=# title="Gyarados (UNITE)">Gyarados</a> presents yet another exception. It learns both of its moves to replace its first two moves, <a href=# title="Splash (move)">Splash</a> and <a href=# title="Flail (move)">Flail</a>, immediately after evolving from <a href=# title="Gyarados (UNITE)">Magikarp</a> instead of at specific levels. This evolution can also occur at any level from 1 to 6, due to Magikarp's ability to evolve if it fills its effort gauge. (Magikarp normally evolves at level 7.)<br clear=all></p><h3><span id=Wild_Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=Wild_Pokémon>Wild Pokémon</span></h3><p>Some <a href=# title="Wild Pokémon">Wild Pokémon</a> are able to use moves in ways similar to player-controlled Pokémon. When a wild Pokémon prepares to use a move, its range can be seen by all players as a red shape projected on the ground. In some cases, the exact time until the move is performed is represented by that red shape filling up in a lighter shade of red, with a filled projection immediately preceding the move's use. In other cases, a yellow bar appears just above the Pokémon, and when that is full the move is performed. In other cases, there is no indication other than the animation of the move. Wild Pokémon do not change the trajectory of their moves based on the movement of their target.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Unite_Move>Unite Move</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/2/26/Thunderstorm_UNITE.png/368px-Thunderstorm_UNITE.png decoding=async width=245 height=138 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=# title="Pikachu (UNITE)">Pikachu</a> using the Unite Move Thunderstorm<p>A <b>Unite Move</b> is powerful move that is unique to Pokémon UNITE. Unite Moves can only be learned and used in Unite Battles <a href=#>[1]</a>. Each Pokémon has a single Unite Move, which is learned at either <a href=# title=Level>Level</a> 8 or 9 depending on the species. These moves do not have cooldowns like normal moves. Instead, in order to use them, the player must have a full Unite Move gauge. The Unite Move gauge slowly fills up on its own, and defeating Pokemon and scoring goals also contributes to filling the gauge. Once a Unite Move is used the Unite Move gauge is emptied. The gauge can be filled before the Pokémon learns its Unite Move.</p><p>Some Unite Moves are based upon other moves in the core series, often being the <a href=# title="Signature move">signature move</a> of the Pokémon if it is not a normal move they can learn in Pokémon UNITE, but have distinct names.</p><p>The icon for a Unite Move with a full Unite Move gauge is always surrounded by a thick yellow outline, like an upgraded move. Compared to those, this outline is larger with a wave pattern.</p><p>Some Unite Moves do not require spending the entire Unite Move gauge to use, instead only consuming a portion of the gauge depending on how the move is used. These moves still require a full Unite Move guage to initiate. For example <a href=# title="Dragonite (UNITE)">Dragonite</a>'s <a href=# title="Dragonite (UNITE)">Draco Impact</a> spends only 50% of the gauge by default, merely causing Dragonite to fly up then come back down along with meteors. However, spending more of the gauge allows Dragonite to use the flying portion of the move to warp to a different location with the attack. Meanwhile, each of the five meteors of <a href=# title="Miraidon (UNITE)">Miraidon</a>'s <a href=# title="Miraidon (UNITE)">Bright Future Meteor Storm</a> costs 30% of the gauge to call down. The move can be concluded at any point to conserve the Unite Move gauge. (Note that Bright Future Meteor Storm is allowed to summon a meteor even if the Unite Move gauge is empty, something that is usually true because 30% multiplied by 5 meteors is 150%.)</p><p>Some Unite Moves, such as <a href=# title="Dragapult (UNITE)">Dragapult</a>'s <a href=# title="Dragapult (UNITE)">Dreep & Destroy</a> and <a href=# title="Blaziken (UNITE)">Blaziken</a>'s <a href=# title="Blaziken (UNITE)">Spinning Flame Fist and Spinning Flame Kick</a>, eschew being tied to the Unite Move gauge. These characters do not have a Unite Move gauge, and their Unite Moves instead have regular cooldowns like other moves. The outline for the icon only appears when the move is off cooldown.</p><p>Unite Moves do not necessarily inflict damage. Some of them primarily provide their user a major buff or apply certain effects to the ground. <a href=# title="Crustle (UNITE)">Crustle</a>'s <a href=# title="Crustle (UNITE)">Rubble Rouser</a> is an example of a buffing Unite Move, while <a href=# title="Comfey (UNITE)">Comfey</a>'s <a href=# title="Comfey (UNITE)">Flowery Fields Forever</a> is an example of creating objects. There are also Unite Moves that exist primarily to buff the team rather than focusing on the user, as seen with <a href=# title="Blissey (UNITE)">Blissey</a>'s <a href=# title="Blissey (UNITE)">Bliss Assistance</a></p><p>Using a Unite Move gives the user a special effect for a brief period of time. This effect varies by Unite Move, but always includes a movement speed increase. It is usually indicated by a user glowing blue, but there are exceptions for certain characters.</p><p>The Pokémon <a href=# title="Urshifu (UNITE)">Urshifu</a> and <a href=# title="Blaziken (UNITE)">Blaziken</a> can learn two Unite Moves. The Unite Move Urshifu learns depends on its <a href=# title="Urshifu (Pokémon)">form</a>, and the Unite Move Blaziken knows at a given time depends on if it is currently in Punch Style or Kick Style.</p><p>As the game's proverbial "ultimates", Unite Moves have the most dramatic visual effects out of any move in Pokémon UNITE. They all darken the screen of the user while being used, as though to emphasize the Pokémon using and being affected by the move. (Some moves have differing effects.) Rarer varieties of <a href=# title=Holowear>Holowear</a> often modify the visual elements of Unite Moves, further enhancing the spectacle.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=List_of_Unite_Moves>List of Unite Moves</span></h3><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Panic_Parade>Panic Parade</span></h2><p>In <a href=# class=new title="Shivre City (Panic Parade) (page does not exist)">Panic Parade</a>, some moves have different effects compared to what they do in other game modes.
