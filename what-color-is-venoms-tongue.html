The <b>slimy pink</b> of his tongue!</span></span><h2>What color is venoms saliva?</h2>Maker casually refers to the green saliva as the symbiote's waste product, which catches Eddie by surprise. Of course, the result is an entertaining exchange where Maker gets to explain that Venom's green saliva is actually how the symbiote excretes the foreign matter that enters the body.<h2>What's with Venom's tongue?</h2>Comic book artist Erik Larsen, who was the first to draw Venom's trademark long and slobbery tongue, explains how he came up with the design. Comic book creator and Image Comics co-founder Erik Larsen has revealed that Venom's trademark long and versatile tongue was actually a bit of an accident.<h2>Why is Venom's tongue long?</h2>"It just kind of takes the curse off of this super scary guy." The great tongue lengthening was originally something of an accident, artist Erik Larson recently explained on Facebook. Larson thought Venom creator Todd McFarlane once illustrated a trade paperback cover with an extended mouth member and so followed suit.<h2>What is Venom original color?</h2>One interesting tidbit is Venom was originally purple before switching to the all-black look seen in the film. As noted by WilliamD1123, a Venom action figure based on the film was purple, because that was the original color scheme for the villain before the change.<h2>VENOM 2 LET THERE BE CARNAGE "Carnage Eats People" : 5 Minute Trailers (4K ULTRA HD) NEW 2021</h2><p></p><h2>Why is Venom Afraid of red?</h2>It could be that in the universe of the Venom movies, this type of strong bond is already known among the symbiotes to result in stronger specimens. This could explain why Venom is so fearful of facing an enemy with a ruddy hue.<h2>Why is Venom's son red?</h2>The spawn of the Venom symbiote then attached itself to Kasady through his bloodstream. Carnage achieves this by entering Kasady's body through a cut on his hand. This is the reason why Carnage appears as the colour red, as he entered through the bloodstream, which is of course red.<h2>What age is Venom?</h2>The USA has Venom at a PG-13 rating, which means anyone under 13 needs a parent or guardian to accompany them to the cinema. As of writing, all of the trailers for Venom have been given a rating of 12A by the British Board of Film Classification.<h2>What does carnage do with tongue?</h2>Sheena Duggal, the VFX Supervisor for the new film, told Variety about a sequence in which Harrelson's villain, Carnage, is seen putting his tongue down someone's throat in order to kill them.<h2>Why is carnage so big in Venom?</h2>Originating as an offspring of Venom, Carnage is much more powerful than its parent symbiote because of the symbiotes' biology, and is in many ways a darker version of him.<h2>Where is Venom's tongue?</h2>As the Fantastic Four leave with Venom and Spider-Man in tow, a young man walks out onto the scene of the battle and finds Venom's severed tongue on the ground. He takes it, hoping to sell it online to make a quick fortune; instead, his apartment is violently broken into and the tongue is stolen.<h2>Who gave Venom the tongue?</h2>Have you ever wondered how Venom got that long, creepy, slime-covered tongue? Well, Savage Dragon creator Erik Larsen -- the first artist to draw the character that way during his run on the Spider-Man titles in the '90s -- shared the story on Facebook.<h2>Does carnage speak?</h2>The Venom symbiote has been seen speaking independently of Eddie (or whoever its host is) on multiple occasions throughout Marvel media, and Eddie almost always refers to himself as “we” when bonded to it.<h2>Why is Venom afraid of Carnage?</h2>The movie doesn't clearly state why, but Venom is probably afraid of Carnage because Carnage doesn't have the moral restrictions that Venom does. They are alien symbiotes. This means they need another living host to bond with if they're going to survive long-term.<h2>Who is green Venom?</h2>In the comics none of the five symbiotes were originally given names. However, in the Venom: Planet of the Symbiotes toy line, the yellow symbiote was named Scream and the green symbiote was named Lasher.<h2>Is Venom weak on his planet?</h2>Am not very well-versed in Spider-Man lore, but Venom himself states that he is sort of a loser on his homeplanet.<h2>What Colour is Carnage teeth?</h2>Physical Appearance<p>Carnage's second appearance is similar to the first version, however the lines around its body have a different pattern, the hands have been reshaped into claws, and the mouth and eyes are more jagged than before. The teeth are now black as opposed to white, and the mouth glows a bright red.</p><h2>Is Venom a gruesome?</h2>The violence, while mostly bloodless, is frequent and intense, with fighting, hitting, punching, and bashing, guns and shooting, stabbing and slicing, car chases, explosions, etc. Some characters die on-screen, and.<h2>Why does Venom have a mouth?</h2>That truth being the disgusting revelation that the symbiote's saliva is actually the answer to a question no comic fan wanted to ask out loud: when Venom eats somebody, what does it do with the... waste? It turns out that the symbiote sends it straight to Venom's mouth.<h2>Does Venom say the F word?</h2>The F-word is dropped once in the movie, very briefly. This is one of the few Marvel movies that have the f-bomb in it and remain PG-13. There is one use of "turd" at the end of the film.<h2>Is Venom 2 kid friendly?</h2>Mature Content. Venom 2 is very graphic, violent, and gory and includes disturbing images of characters being beheaded, impaled, stabbed, hung, strangled, etc. It's well, full of carnage. There is a flashback cartoon of murders that can be too intense for children.<h2>Why is Venom 15?</h2>The buttons for "violence" and "swearing" are labeled "too much" and while there is swearing and lots of violence in this film, I don't think there is "too much" of either.<h2>Who is blue Venom?</h2>Blue Symbiote (1) (Mayhem): In the comics Mayhem was a biologically reengineered being as a human and symbiote hybrid. The character April gave herself the name Mayhem to operate under in her superhuman activities, but she died in an explosion while fighting Spider-Girl.<h2>Why is Anti-Venom white?</h2>Brock is enveloped in a new white “Anti-Venom” symbiote when remnants of the Venom symbiote in his body merge with special antibodies (produced by his white blood cells) due to Li's Lightforce energy.<h2>Is the black Spider-Man suit Venom?</h2>The Black Suit, otherwise known as the Symbiote Suit, is a living, breathing entity now known as the Venom Symbiote. It's seen a storied history of its own, beginning with Spider-Man before taking its own shape with photojournalist Eddie Brock to become the fan-favorite anti-hero Venom.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lk6S5sL6MoqpmrpWjvK6%2FjK2mp5%2Blmg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-jesse-williams.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Jesse Williams? | The US Sun</a>
