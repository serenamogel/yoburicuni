Who is She Dating?</h2><p>If <strong>Lysa TerKeurst</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@lysaterkeurst</a>) thought that she would never find love again after she got divorced from her husband of almost 29 years in 2022, how wrong she was! Because she seems to have gotten himself a new boyfriend who makes her much happier than her ex-husband ever made her.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/06/lysa-terkeurst-pic1.jpg alt="Lysa TerKeurst seems to have been dating a new boyfriend. houseandwhips.com " width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Lysa TerKeurst seems to have been dating a new boyfriend.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Relevant Magazine</strong></p><p>It was a devastating time for Lysa when she was forced to end her marriage with <strong>Art TerKeurst</strong> and get separated from him forever after he continued to remain unfaithful. Their marriage was already on the brink of death and they had already split up in 2017 but the writer had some hopes that somehow they would make it through when they renewed their vows a year later. But after Art made no effort and she found that "it's hard to face a future that looks nothing like what I desperately and constantly prayed it would look like," their relationship came to an end for good in 2022.</p><p>Now, a year and a half later, Lysa TerKeurst seems to have found a future that she wanted and prayed for. She seems to have gotten a second chance at love with a new man. And she wants to share with the world that she has found love again. So, she posted on Instagram a picture of herself smiling away to glory with her new boyfriend CA. In that picture of them together walking hand-in-hand, she wrote a caption "<a href=# rel=noopener>a new chapter</a>."</p><p>Though Lysa hasn't really labeled the new man her new boyfriend, she is most likely dating him. From their pictures, it looks as though she's so in love so, it has to be someone she's in a romantic relationship with. She has not shared much about him and refers to him as "CA" maybe because she wants to protect his privacy but she has posted a video of pictures and clips of them together, and the way she admires him and looks at him, she's definitely in love with him.</p><h2>Lysa TerKeurst Seems to Be in Love With Her New Boyfriend!</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/06/lysa-terkeurst-pic2.jpg alt="Lysa TerKeurst seems to be in love with her new man. houseandwhips.com " width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Lysa TerKeurst seems to be in love with her new man.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Instagram</strong></p><p><strong>Lysa TerKeurst</strong> seems happier than ever with her new boyfriend.
