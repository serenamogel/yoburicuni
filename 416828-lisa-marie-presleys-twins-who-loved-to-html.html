She experienced her share of troubles, including a highly publicized divorce and a bitter custody battle that lasted almost five years.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Lisa Marie Presley with her daughters Harper and Finley on April 5, 2014 in Tokyo, Japan | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The singer had four children from two different marriages. Her youngest are fraternal twins Harper and Finley, whom she loved dearly. The twins, who recently celebrated their 15th birthday, have gone through a lot of changes and challenges in their lives, especially after their parents' divorce and the subsequent death of their mother.</p><h2 style=text-align:center class=_g><strong class=Ug>The Twins' Arrival and Growing Up in the Spotlight</strong></h2><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Harper and Finley were born via cesarean section on October 7, 2008, to Lisa Marie and her husband, Michael Lockwood, a guitarist and producer. At the time of <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/lisa-marie-presleys-twin-girls-named-finley-harper/>their birth</a>, Lisa Marie, who was 40 years old, had two teenage children from her first marriage to <a class="ae -U" href=#>Danny Keough</a>: a daughter named Riley and a son named Benjamin.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The twins were born with a flair for showbiz running in their veins, which is no surprise considering their mother and grandfather's musical talent and charisma, not to mention their father, Lockwood, is also in the entertainment industry.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The girls didn't want to be just spectators when they tagged along to shows. Their mother revealed they wanted a piece of the action, and they'd be itching to grab a mic and hit the dance floor. She <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BkRHwmUhHFr/>added</a>:</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>"At home, they act out scenes and have everybody sit down and watch them. They're entertaining as hell."</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The entertainment gene is not the only thing Harper and Finley inherited. Glamor is part of the family package, too. One time, when preparing to go on tour, Lisa Marie shared that she had another mission to carry out, courtesy of her twins. They had turned her into a princess dress detective, scouring the cities and towns she toured for dresses befitting her little fashionistas' style.</p><h2 style=text-align:center class=_g><strong class=Ug>The Parents' Divorce and Custody Battle</strong></h2><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The twins' happy childhood was disrupted by their parents' divorce, which <a class="ae -U" href=#>Lisa Marie</a> filed in June 2016 after ten years of marriage. The divorce was messy and bitter, with allegations of financial mismanagement by Lockwood, who was in charge of his wife's assets. At the time, her lawyer <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/crime/lisa-marie-presley-divorces-husband-over-money-issues-and-parenting-problems/>stated</a>:</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>"They're not trying to work it out and get back together. She's done."</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Lisa Marie claimed that Lockwood was not a good father and that he had inappropriate photos of children on his computer. On these grounds, Lisa filed for full custody of the twins. Lockwood denied the accusations and accused her of ruining his reputation.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>In retaliation, he filed for custody and spousal support. Amid this heated battle, rumors and speculations started going around that the girls had been placed in foster care. But in February 2017, Lisa Marie's mother, Priscilla, cleared the air in a <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.facebook.com/ms.priscilla.presley/photos/a.621571104539428.1073741825.402620969767777/1529514527078410/?type=3&theater">Facebook post</a>.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>She stated that her granddaughters were staying with her and had never been in foster care, nor would they ever be.

However, they found a way to cope and help others by fostering puppies from a local animal shelter. Lisa Marie posted a photo of them holding an adorable dog and <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-GIP0al9nQ/>wrote</a>, "We've been fostering pups from a shelter. Exhausting but so rewarding."</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>After the protracted custody battle, Lisa Marie and Lockwood's divorce proceedings concluded in May 2021, and the former spouses maintained joint custody of their twin daughters.</p><h2 style=text-align:center class=_g><strong class=Ug>Lisa Marie's Untimely Death</strong></h2><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The twins suffered a devastating loss in January 2023 when their mother, Lisa Marie, died at 54.
